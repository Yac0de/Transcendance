This is what will be sent when the client wants to create a tournament. When the client sends this message,
the code will be an empty string. When the server returns it back, it will send it with a code which can be passed 
to other clients to join the lobby. When a player creates a tournament, he is immediately put as the player1 of this tournament

(Sent with an empty string by the client, returned with a lobby code by the server)

export interface createTournamentLobby {
  type: 'CREATE_TOURNAMENT_LOBBY';
  userId: number;
  code: number;
}

This will be sent when the client inputs a code and click join on the website.
If the client that sent the message receive the same message back, it means success and I will send the client to the Tournament Lobby

(player id will be 0 if no player is here yet.)

export interface TournamentLobbyState {
  type: 'TOURNAMENT_LOBBY_STATE';
  creatorId: number;
  code: number;
  player1Id: number;
  player2Id: number;
  player3Id: number;
  player4Id: number;
}

export interface joinTournamentWithCode {
  type: 'JOIN_TOURNAMENT_WITH_CODE';
  userId: number;
  code: string;
}

It will also send another message to all the other client in the lobby. Something like this:
