This will be sent when the client inputs a code and click join on the website.
If the client that sent the message receive the same message back, it means success and I will send the client to the Tournament Lobby
It will also send the message to all the client in the lobby described by this code.

export interface joinTournamentWithCode {
  type: 'JOIN_TOURNAMENT_WITH_CODE';
  userId: number;
  code: string;
}

This is what will be sent when the client wants to create a tournament. When the client sends this message,
the code will be an empty string. When the server returns it back, it will send it with a code which can be passed 
to other clients to join the lobby.

(Sent with an empty string by the client, returned with a lobby code by the server)
export interface createTournamentLobby {
  type: 'CREATE_TOURNAMENT_LOBBY';
  userId: number;
  code: number;
}
